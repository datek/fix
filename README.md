# Fix - Test fixtures made easy!

- Fixtures are being evaluated only once per test (`*testing.T`), no matter how many times they're being called

- Fixtures resolve their dependencies

- Zero dependencies

- Inspired by [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

## Examples

See the `examples` folder and `fixture_test.go`
